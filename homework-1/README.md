# Benchmarking

The objective is to measure the performance differences of two processors, through several steps:
- data collection by running the benchmark independently on both machines;
- verification of normality of distributions;
- application of the corrected hypothesis test on the differences of the samples collected in order to establish their statistical significance.

We chose to investigate the influence of virtualisation on the measurements by carrying out these operations even in the absence of CPU virtualisation, in order to measure its impact.
