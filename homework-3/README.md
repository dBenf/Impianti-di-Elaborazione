# Web Server

The objective is to obtain a synthetic workload based on a real workload generated from a few client requests to a local web server, having already identified the work points of the web server itself.
An overview is then given of the different phases implemented.

## Capacity Test
This phase consists of evaluating **throughput** and **response time** under varying loads, and identifying points of *usable* and *knee* capacity.

## Workload Characterisation
This phase consists of **system workload characterisation**, in terms of *low-level* and *high-level* parameters, and also verifying that the synthetic workload is representative of the real workload.

## Design Of Experiment
This phase consists of **studying the influence of various factors** on response time, and assessing their *significance* and *importance*.
