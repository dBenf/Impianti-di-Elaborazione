# Field-Failure Data Analysis

The objective is to conduct a failure-based analysis (**FFDA**) on some error log files of two different supercomputers, *Mercury* and *Blue Gene/L* through different stages:
- **sensitivity analysis** for choosing the optimal *coalescence window*;
- application of the **tupling** algorithm for grouping failures;
- identification of the **empirical reliability curves**;
- **fitting** of the empirical curves with known distributions.
